# ðŸ“° Talk2News Chatbot

**Talk2News** is an interactive chatbot that provides fresh, reliable answers based on recent news articles.  
It is built as part of a final-year thesis, focusing on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with local LLM inference.

The system fetches articles from multiple news sources, indexes them into a vector store, and answers user questions strictly based on the **most relevant and recent article**.

##  Features Implemented

- **Web Crawling & RSS Feeds**
  - Automated crawler fetches articles from multiple news sites.
  - Metadata extraction (title, date, category, author).

- **Database**
  - MongoDB for storing full articles with metadata.
  - Duplicate detection using hash keys.

- **Vector Store & Retrieval**
  - HuggingFace embeddings (`all-mpnet-base-v2`).
  - FAISS vector index for similarity search.
  - Hybrid retrieval: similarity + recency boost + BM25 re-ranking.
  - Selection of a **single best article** per query.

- **LLM Integration**
  - Local inference with **LLaMA 3** (quantized GGUF).
  - Prompting designed to return **concise, fact-based answers**.
  - Extractive snippet mechanism when available.

- **Frontend**
  - React-based chat interface (served without build tools, via Babel & CDN).
  - Custom **logo and branding**.
  - Persistent chat history (localStorage).
